# Docker-calculator
<h3><em>About the project:</em> </h3> 
<p> A simple nodejs project, impelemented using express framework, the project is a simple api-based calculator, based on the  
    values and operator given in the request, the application calculates the result and send it via the response api.<br>
    </p>


<h3><em>Tools used for the project:</em> </h3>

<ul>
  <li>Node js</li>
  <li>Express js frame work</li>
  <li>Thunder client/ Nodemon (optional, just for the use of testing, sending some requests and see the responses)</li>
</ul>

<h3><em>Goal from the poject:</em> </h3>
<p>The main goal from creating this project is just to illustrate how api-based applications work, understanding some of the main 
    concepts of express js, APIs, node js , etc.<br>
    <strong>More importantly, I created this project to learn and practice docker</strong>, i.e  how to creates images, containarazion,
    docker-compress,etc.
</p>

<h3><em> Building steps:</em> </h3>
<ol>
  <li>NPM installation: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npmr</lh>
  <li>Get NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/</li>
  <li>To simplify your life, yu can use Nodemon: https://nodemon.io/</li>  
 </ol>
 <p>Once you have the above tools ready, do the following steps:</p>  
    <ol>
        <li>Start by running the applicatoin using nodejs: <code>node app.js</code></li>
        <li>You can use nodemon if you want requests, the port is <strong> 5000<strong>, <br>it can be changed, just modify the port var in the code if you want to.</li>
</ol>
            
<h3><em> Dockerization steps:</em> </h3>            
    <bre>- You will need to install docker to your local matchine in order to be able to run/containarize/create images/other docker-realted usage  
     - check the following link to download/learn more about docker: https://docs.docker.com/
     - Once you have docker installed, you can proceed to the following steps to doc
